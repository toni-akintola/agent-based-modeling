# Huang Track Records Model
A bandit model created by [Alice C.W. Huang](https://alicecwhuang.github.io/), which depicts how scientific networks whose agents depend heavily upon track records to make judgments about the credence of hypotheses may be less accurate than networks whose agents rely more on evidential reasoning to judge hypotheses.

## Abstract
> In the literature on expert trust, it is often assumed that track records are the gold
standard for evaluating expertise, and the difficulty of expert identification arises from
either the lack of access to track records, or the inability to assess them (Goldman [2001];
Schurz [2012]; Nguyen [2020]). I show, using a computational model, that even in an
idealized environment where agents have a Godâ€™s eye view on track records, they may fail
to identify experts. Under plausible conditions, selecting testimony based on track records
ends up reducing overall accuracy, and preventing the community from identifying the
real experts.
